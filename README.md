This is my just for fun project. Aim is to create a software that will allow to play many different games on the Local Area Networks (LAN).
At the beggining only 2 games will be supported: tic-tac-toe (as the most simple to implement) and Go (a.k.a. baduk, a.k.a. weichi/weiqi) which I'm the most interested in.
